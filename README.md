# Number-input

My first attempt at creating an ember addon

## Description
A basic input text control that only allows integer or floating decimal numbers with up to two decimal place precision.

## To use
Use it like a regular InputText in Ember:

```{{number-input value=value maxlength=6}}```

## To Install
Install it like any other ember addon.
